# MyPythonToolBox
I created this repository to be able to make available to anyone interested some of the python classes I created to help me in the work of "everyday" to automate some "boring" operations that otherwise I would have to do "by hand". As I said before, anyone interested in using them or helping me and expanding the repository is welcome.
